# Description
Device connection and data transmission via UART â€“ a simple example. 
UART is emulated using socat. 

For Linux-based systems.

# How to run

### Create connection
To start connection run:
```bash
bash ./scripts/create_connection.sh
```
when connection no longer needed: Ctrl+C

## Communication simulation
### Python version
Start transmission:
```bash
 python ./transmission/python/transmitter.py --rate-hz=10
```

Start receiver in another terminal:
```bash
 python ./transmission/python/receiver.py
```

### C version (currently just a minimal example)
Compile code:
```bash
 cd ./transmission/c/
 gcc transmitter.c -o transmitter
 gcc receiver.c -o receiver
```
Start receiver:
```bash
 ./receiver
```
Start transmitter in another terminal:
```bash
 ./transmitter
```
